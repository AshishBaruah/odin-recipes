      <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds andouille sausage, sliced</li>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>½ cup canola oil</li>

        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium green bell pepper, chopped</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Steps</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cook sausage in a Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring constantly
          until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage to a bowl; reserve
          drippings in Dutch oven.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook chicken in drippings over medium heat until both sides browned, 2
          to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in the Dutch oven over medium heat. Add flour; cook and stir
          constantly until roux is thick and choculate colored, 20 to 30
          minutes. Be careful not to burn roux or you'll have to start again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add celery, onion, and bell pepper; cook and stir for 6 minutes. Add
          garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in hot broth; bring
          to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add chicken breasts, Worcestershire sauce, Creole seasoning, thyme,
          pepper flakes, and bay leaves. Reduce heat; simmer, stirring
          occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices
          run clear, about 1 hour. Transfer chicken to a plate; cool.
        </li>
        <li>Add sausage to gumbo; simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Shred cooled chicken. Add chicken and green onions to gumbo; simmer
          for 30 minutes.
